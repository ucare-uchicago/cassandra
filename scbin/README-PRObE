Instructions for working on PRObE cluster 

1. Generate machine list by running `gen_nmc_machinelist`
gen_nmc_machine.sh receives the number of machines as the first
argument. Sometime some machines in the cluster cannot start up, and
we do not want to use those machines, we can tell gen_nmc_machine.sh
to skip involving them by writing their indexes into a file name
`skiplist`. The format is one index number per line.

2. Customize scdeploy.conf
For num_node variable, we should assign how many Cassandra processes in one
machine. The number of all Cassandra instances = num_node * the number of
machines

3. Set up alias IP address
Set up alias IP address by running `cluster_ip_setup`. We have to call this on
the machine in the cluster not Nome machine (e.g. node-1.scale.ucare-nome.nx).

4. Set up operating directory
Set up operating directory for every machine in our running by running
`cluster_dir_setup`. We have to call this on the machine in the cluster not
Nome machine (e.g. node-1.scale.ucare-nome.nx).

5. Run Cassandra
Running `cluster_start`

6. Stop Cassandra
Running `cluster_stop`
